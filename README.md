# etch-a-sketch
a browser version of a sketchpad 

To use, open the browser version of the code. 

I made this project with focus on the backend and the systems behind DOMs and DOM manipulation. I exhausted the bug list and squashed as many as I could find - there shouldn't be any, but if there are: let me know. 

The grid creator function is my proudest achievement so far, I have spent hours and hours on end trying to come up with a formula that would be pixel perfect. 

Now you can enjoy it with the change grid size button in seconds. 

Hopefully, you find this as fun to play with as I did. 

Also: if you want to try your take on the project, here are the guidelines:
